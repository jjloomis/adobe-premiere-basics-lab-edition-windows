# Importing media files

Before you can edit your media files, youâ€™ll need to import them into your **Premiere** project. Once imported, your media files will appear as clips in the **Project** panel.

1. If you have not already done so, copy all of your media files into your project folder. Note: If you do not copy your media files into your project folder, you will lose your media files. Your **Premiere** project will not work.
2. In your **Premiere** project, go to **File** on the menu bar and choose **Import**.
3. [Navigate](https://techresources.gitbook.io/file-and-folder-management-windows-edition/navigating-folder-tree) to your project folder and the select the media files you would like to import. **Note**: If you[ copied an AVCHD folder from a Canon video camera](../setting-up-your-project/adding-media-from-a-video-camera.md) into your project folder, the path to the MTS files is: `Renamed-AVCHD-folder\BDMV\STREAM`. **Control-click files** to select more than one at a time.
4. Click **Import**. Your media files will appear as clips the **Project** panel.
