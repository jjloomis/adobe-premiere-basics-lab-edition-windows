# Renaming clips in the Project panel

**Note**: Renaming clips in the **Project** panel will help keep your project organized, but this process is optional.&#x20;

1. In the **Project** panel, select a clip and then click its name.
2. Give the clip a new name. Follow [JAMS file and folder naming conventions](https://techresources.gitbook.io/file-and-folder-management-windows/file-and-folder-naming-conventions).
