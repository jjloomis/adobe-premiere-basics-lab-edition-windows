# Copying WAV files from a Zoom H2n to your project folder

Before editing the audio you captured with your **Zoom** recorder, you'll copy the **WAV** files in to your [**project folder**](creating-a-project-folder.md).

**Note**: Never import **WAV** files into **Premiere** directly from a **Zoom** recorder. Copy the **WAV** files into your [**project folder**](creating-a-project-folder.md). Then [import](../importing-and-logging-clips/importing-media-files.md) the **WAV** files into **Premiere** from your [**project folder**](creating-a-project-folder.md)**.**

### Zoom H2n <a href="#zoom-h2n" id="zoom-h2n"></a>

1. Make sure **Zoom H2n** is **off**. (**Important**: **Zoom H2n** must be **off** in order for this process to work.)
2. Connect the **Zoom H2n** to your PC using the **USB cable**. The **Zoom H2n** will power up (even though itâ€™s not turned on.)
3. On the **Zoom H2n**, use the **Play wheel** to select **SD Card Reader**.
4. On your PC, Go to **This PC** to see all connected devices and drives.
5. A new drive titled **H2N\_SD** should appear in the **This PC** window.
6. Double click the **H2N\_SD** drive to open it.
7. Double click the **Stereo** folder.
8. In the **Stereo** folder, double click **FOLDER01**. All of your audio files will appear in this folder. By default, audio files will have the following name format: **ZOOM000X.WAV.** (**Note**: The date and time stamps for the audio files will not be correct.)
9. Select all of the **WAV** files in **FOLDER01**. (**Control A** is an easy keyboard shortcut to select everything in a folder.) Copy all of the **WAV** files in to your [**project folder**](creating-a-project-folder.md).
