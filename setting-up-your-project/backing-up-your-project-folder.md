### **Connecting to your class folder**

2. When you are done working for the day, **right-click** the **Start** button (bottom left) and select **File Explorer**.&#x20;
3. In the **File Explorer** window, select **This PC** (on left.)&#x20;
4. Right-click **This PC** (on left.) In the fly-out menu that appears, select **Map network drive.**
5. In the **Map Network Drive** box, leave the default **Drive** letter selected. In the **Folder** field, copy and paste the following string (be sure to copy the full string): \
   \
   `\\ad.uwm.edu\shares\_U_LS\Courses\JAMS`\

6. Click **Finish**. Your class folder will appear in the **This PC** area as a connected drive (probably the **Z** drive.)&#x20;
7. If necessary, [navigate](https://app.gitbook.com/@techresources/s/file-and-folder-management-windows-edition/navigating-folder-tree) to your class folder.
